# 🚀 Major Engineering Project – Industrial Automation Platform

At my current role in Germany, I contribute to a **large-scale industrial automation platform** built with .NET microservices, RabbitMQ, and Angular.  
This platform acts as an orchestration layer between automation equipment, enterprise services, and data systems.

### 🌉 Platform Role
- Orchestrates workflows between distributed industrial systems  
- Processes machine-related events and state transitions  
- Coordinates backend services responsible for data aggregation and workflow progression  
- Supports multiple sites and a large distributed microservice ecosystem  

### 🧠 Execution Flow Logic
- Workflow rules are defined via version-controlled configuration  
- Execution logic adapts dynamically based on product and system parameters  
- Configuration is cached and refreshed on schedule or when updated  

### 🔄 Messaging & Orchestration
- Built on MassTransit SAGA patterns over RabbitMQ  
- Handles various operational events and system triggers  
- Ensures consistency, retries, and event ordering  
- Supports long-running workflows handled across many services  

### 📊 Observability
- Full request tracing and diagnostics using Grafana & Loki  
- Performance metrics, event timelines, and system health monitoring  

### 🚢 Deployment
- .NET services deployed as containerized applications  
- CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps  
- Automated deployment via a standardized deployment system  

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role in the Platform

I contribute to backend services that support orchestration, data processing, integrations, and workflow logic.

### Key Responsibilities
- Implementing workflow activities, state transitions, and process logic  
- Developing message consumers for event-driven communication  
- Designing message contracts and event schemas  
- Contributing to backend integration with external services and APIs  
- Implementing caching and configuration refresh logic  
- Building backend modules for data aggregation and processing  
- Performance tuning and diagnostics using observability tools  
- Providing debugging and support during rollout phases  
- Ensuring strong unit test coverage and mocked workflow tests
